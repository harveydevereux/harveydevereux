### [On Gitlab since Feb 2023](https://gitlab.com/apw951)

But [AlphaShapes.jl](https://github.com/harveydevereux/AlphaShapes.jl), part of the [Julia general package registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General), and [Consensus](https://github.com/harveydevereux/Consensus) may interest you!

## Harvey Devereux

### Working on... 

[DL_POLY](https://gitlab.com/ccp5/dl-poly) (Classical Molecular Dynamics, Fortran90-2018, MPI, CMake) and its Python meta package [dlpoly-py](https://gitlab.com/drFaustroll/dlpoly-py), on a Postdoc at Queen Mary University of London

I'm also developing [Active Matter simulations in DL_POLY](https://gitlab.com/apw951/dl_poly_active)
